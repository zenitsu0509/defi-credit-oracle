## Low-Scoring Wallets (0-300) Analysis

**Number of High-Risk Wallets**: 1,980

### Characteristics of High-Risk Wallets:

- **Average Score**: 270.4
- **Average Transactions**: 3.0
- **Average USD Volume**: 7.55e+21
- **Average Activity Duration**: 3.8 days

### Common Risk Factors in Low-Scoring Wallets:

- **Average Liquidations**: 0.366 (higher liquidation risk)
- **Average Repay-to-Borrow Ratio**: 0.649 (poor repayment behavior)
- **Average Borrow-to-Deposit Ratio**: 0.545 (high leverage)

## Key Behavioral Patterns

### Most Important Predictive Features:

The machine learning model identified the following features as most important for credit scoring:

1. **repay_to_borrow_ratio**: 0.8627
2. **activity_duration_days**: 0.0278
3. **liquidation_ratio**: 0.0188
4. **deposit_count**: 0.0185
5. **liquidation_risk**: 0.0167
6. **deposit_ratio**: 0.0134
7. **borrow_ratio**: 0.0098
8. **borrow_to_deposit_ratio**: 0.0080
9. **asset_diversity**: 0.0051
10. **liquidation_count**: 0.0043

### Behavioral Insights:

1. **Repayment Behavior**: The repay-to-borrow ratio is the strongest predictor of creditworthiness. Wallets with ratios above 0.8 consistently score higher.

2. **Activity Duration**: Long-term users (90+ days) demonstrate more stable and responsible behavior.

3. **Asset Diversification**: Wallets using multiple assets (5+ different tokens) show more sophisticated DeFi usage patterns.

4. **Liquidation Risk**: Any liquidation history severely impacts credit scores, indicating high-risk behavior.

5. **Transaction Patterns**: Consistent transaction sizes and moderate frequency indicate human-like, responsible usage.

## Recommendations

### For High-Risk Wallets:
- Improve repayment ratios by paying back borrowed amounts consistently
- Reduce leverage (borrow-to-deposit ratio) to minimize liquidation risk
- Diversify asset usage to demonstrate broader DeFi knowledge
- Maintain consistent transaction patterns over longer periods

### For Protocol Development:
- Consider implementing early warning systems for wallets showing declining credit scores
- Develop incentive mechanisms for wallets with excellent credit scores
- Create educational resources for improving DeFi financial behavior

### For Risk Management:
- Use credit scores as one factor in lending decisions
- Monitor score changes over time to identify emerging risks
- Consider different scoring models for different user segments

## Methodology Notes

- **Data Source**: Aave V2 protocol transaction data
- **Scoring Range**: 0-1000 (higher = better)
- **Features**: 25+ behavioral and risk indicators
- **Model**: Random Forest with rule-based baseline
